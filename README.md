# iGotACanon-EOS-R8-inDec2024AndIDunnoHowToUseItCompletelyOrHowToTakeASelfieButIWillTryOneWeekend

im not saying that i cant figure it out, i know there are videos on how to use it on youtube and theyre like an hr long ... lol

BUT its not an entry level camera and theres some technical overhead to get over before u can take a good picture??

the battery lasts an hr tho which i dont like

maybe this weekend ill pull it out again lol its just sitting in the camera bag T_T

the guy at best buy was like "why are you getting such a complicated camera if you have no experience with cameras" and i was like "i dunno, im bored??"
